        <p> HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to structure content on the web. 
            It uses elements made up of tags (like p, h1, a, img) to define different types of content 
            such as text, headings, links, images, and more. An HTML document starts with !DOCTYPE html
            and is wrapped in html, with two main parts: the head, which contains metadata (like the 
            page title, styles, and scripts), and the body, which holds the visible content. Elements 
            can have attributes (like href for links or src for images) that give extra information. 
            Together, these tags and attributes form the building blocks of web pages, which can then 
            be styled with CSS and made interactive with JavaScript.</p>

        <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the language used to control the look and layout of web pages. 
            It works alongside HTML by selecting elements (like p, h1, or .class) and applying styles such as 
            colors, fonts, sizes, spacing, borders, and positioning. CSS uses a selector → property: value format. 
            Styles can be applied inline (inside an HTML tag), internal (inside a style block in the HTML head), 
            or external (linked from a .css file, which is the best practice). CSS also supports classes (.classname)
             and IDs (#idname) for targeting specific elements, and its “cascading” nature means that styles are applied 
             in order of importance and source. With CSS, developers can create layouts, add responsive design for different
              screen sizes, and give web pages their visual identity.</p>
